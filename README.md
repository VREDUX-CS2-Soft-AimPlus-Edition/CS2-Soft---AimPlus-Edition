### ⚙️ What Makes VREDUX Different?

VREDUX is not a generic enhancement tool — it's a precision-built soft aimed at competitive CS2 players who need silent assistance without being detected. Unlike overloaded public builds, this soft is lightweight, low-profile, and easily configurable. It doesn't rely on injected overlays or flashy visuals, but on backend logic that's been tested to remain undetected on major anticheats.

- Seamless injection that doesn’t conflict with system memory protection
- Developed with low resource usage in mind — under 3% CPU in idle state
- Uses encrypted communication only when syncing configs (optional)
- Advanced bypass routines are updated weekly to match VAC patterns

### 📘 How to Use VREDUX in Real Matches

Whether you’re playing classic matchmaking, FACEIT, or community servers, VREDUX offers versatile tools that blend perfectly into any gameplay scenario.

- In close-range battles, use mid-FOV smoothing to assist flick shots naturally
- For ESP, only enable enemies + weapons with fade opacity — zero suspicion
- Set the triggerbot to work only when scoped — ideal for AWP/Scout users
- Configure hotkeys per weapon class to switch profiles automatically

You can also create situational configs — one for passive lurk play and another for aggressive entry fragging — and swap them with a single keybind mid-match.
